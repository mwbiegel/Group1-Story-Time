We went to the Biergarten to hang out in the lovely afternoon.
Three of us showed up in a fancy BMW.
"Sorry I'm late, there was so much traffic on the Hauptstrasse!"
We are more than ready to eat some gebaeck.
Schloss was our choice of adventure of the evening.
Until a stray Hund chased us up a tree.
"Lets climb into the window of this schloss to escape!"
Hopefully, our lederhoses don't get ripped trying to climb in the window.
Dang I am really hungry, a Doener sounds amazing.
